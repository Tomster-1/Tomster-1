# Hi, I'm Thomas & here's my Engineering Portfolio on GitHub.👋

I'm a **3rd-year MEng Mechanical Engineering** student at the **University of Exeter**.  
I’m interested in **simulation-led engineering** (CFD/FEA/control), **numerical methods**, and **practical design for manufacture** work that actually ships.
I’m also interested in **data-centric engineering** as a future study focus: designing scalable, reliable data systems for quantitative finance, including streaming market data, low-latency pipelines,
data validation/monitoring, labeling & feature stores, reproducible research (experiment tracking), and deployment workflows that turn raw data into tradable signals.

Some of the repositories here are either:
- **coursework/practical submissions exported from Jupyter/MATLAB**, or
- **cleaned scripts extracted from those notebooks** (so the structure can be a bit “cell-by-cell”; not a polished package)

I keep them public as a transparent record of my work and progress.

## Previous Works
- **Control systems (MATLAB):** transfer functions, feedback loops, pole–zero maps, stability checks, step/impulse/ramp responses
- **Numerical methods (Python):** ODE simulation (Euler, RK2/Heun, `odeint`), timestep studies, error analysis, validation
- **Machine learning (Python):** MLPs/CNNs for classification, hyperparameter sweeps, evaluation + visualisations
- **Engineering design:** manufacturability-focused thinking, iterative build/test, clear reporting
- **CFD fundamentals:** boundary-layer modelling and similarity solutions (e.g., Blasius)

## Featured repositories
- **Control-Systems-Analysis-in-MATLAB**  
  Closed-loop analysis, stability assessment, pole–zero maps, and time-domain responses for multiple feedback systems.

- **Mass-Spring-Damper-Simulation-Euler-vs-Heun-vs-odeint**  
  Coupled mechanical system simulation under an impulse-like input. Compares Euler vs Heun (RK2) vs `odeint`, includes damping-ratio estimation and error plots.

- **Neural-Network-Classification-Casting-Defect-Detection**  
  Python code extracted from an academic Jupyter submission. Covers classification, hyperparameter tuning, and casting defect detection using MLPs and CNNs.

- **Blasius Boundary-Layer Calculator (Shooting Method)**  
  Numerical solver for the **Blasius similarity ODE** using a shooting method + root finding, with velocity profiles and boundary-layer metrics (e.g., `f''(0)`, `delta_99`, displacement thickness).

## Future work
- **Data-centric engineering:** building pipelines around real test/production data (cleaning, feature engineering, uncertainty, model validation) to improve engineering decisions and system performance.
- Packaging future projects into **reproducible scripts** (less “notebook-style”), with clearer inputs/outputs.

---

## Tools
- **Python:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- **MATLAB:** Control System Toolbox, simulation + plotting workflows
- **CAD/CFD (when needed):** SolidWorks, ANSYS (Fluent/Mechanical)

## Background
Alongside uni, I’ve worked in hands-on and client-facing roles (including plumbing/site work and compliance auditing), which has made me comfortable owning tasks end-to-end, communicating clearly and working to standards.
